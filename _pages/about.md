### About / Interests

* I am motivated to understand the rules of life that allow organisms to persist in our ever-changing world. Coastal marine molluscs are ideal models due to their semi-sessile lifestyle and habitat amidst a multitude of anthropogenic challenges - for this particular reason, I believe estuaries and populous coastlines write an ideal recipe for marine research, education, and industry to blend harmoniously. 

* During my master's research, I encouraged academic, public, and  architectural communities to "Tell it from the heart". Bio-sensing via real-time physiological activity yields a charismatic perspective for water quality standardization and habitat restoration in coastal systems. In particular,  dynamic challenges such as diel-cycling oxygen availability demands high-resolution responses. My thesis in the ([Volkenborn lab (SBU)](https://you.stonybrook.edu/samuelgurr/)) applied non-invasive heartbeat rate sensors, ([designed by Drs. Fernando Lima and Rui Seabra](http://www.electricblue.eu/about/)), *in-situ* and in laboratory challenges as a proxy for whole animal metabolic activity of bay scallops *Argopecten irradians*. A conceptual model "Cardiac response to diel-cycling dissolved oxygen" (CRDDO) was proposed from this data outlining the oxyregulatory and oxyconformity transitions molluscs undergo during coastal hypoxia ([Gurr et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098117304185)). I later interned and consulted at Autodesk and in collaboration with the Hudson River Project to translate my thesis research into an interactive exhibit for public education ([referenced in New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/nyregion/new-york-today-hudson-river-fish.html).

* As part of my doctoral research ([Putnam Lab](http://putnamlab.com/)), I worked alongside growers in the shellfish aquaculture industry to investigate techniques for hatchery enhancement. I used bioinformatic tools to understand the influence of early-life 'programming windows' when acclimation, or priming/hormesis, can buffer against subsequent environmental change. Check out my [open hatchery handbook for Pacific geoduck clams](https://github.com/SamGurr/Geoduck_handbook/blob/master/Geoduck_aquaculture.md) - all in collaboration with the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe and Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in Brinnon, WA!

* Molecular adjustments (i.e. gene expression, genetic and non-genetic variation, etc.) affecting phenotype are potentially transient, dynamic, and interdependent and remain poorly understood. As a postdoctoral associate at Milford, [NOAA Contractor/Affiliate](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/sam-gurr-phd) today I work alongside a multidisciplinary team on a long-term Bay scallop rearing project. I seek to synthesize physiological, cellular, and multi-omics data to understand the adaptive machinery underpinning environmental resilience (i.e. attenuated mitochondrial capacity/signaling, gene expression, genetic and non-genetic variation, etc.) within and across generational timescales.
