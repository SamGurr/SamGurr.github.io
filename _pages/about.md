### About
I am PhD student at Univeristy of Rhode Island in the Putnam Lab. My current research is focused on enhancement stradegies to improve sustainable Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) aquaculture through stress conditioning under ocean acidification.

   * Estuaries and populous coasts write an ideal recipe for marine research, education, and industry to work harmoneously. I am particularly inspired by semi-sessile invertebrates that lack effective mobility to evade effects of anthropogenic activity in our modern and future coastlines.
   * Current research with Drs. Hollie Putnam (URI), Steven Roberts (UW), and Brent Vadoppalas (UW) is in collaboration with the Jametown S'klallam Tribe and Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in Washington State. Our research at the hatchery explores stress-conditioning as a viable strategy for hatchery enhancement - this is a unique oppportunity to complete rigorous xperiments in a production setting where aspects of ecology, logistics, and economics all play a vital role in experimental design and the broader applications of our findings. Pilot studies are currently developing into exciting hypothesis that expand  mulitple generations and address physiological and genetic mechanisms. More to come to stay tuned!
   * My previous grad-level  research exerience used non-invasive heartbeat rate sensors in-situ and in laboratory challenges as a proxy for whole animal metabolic activity under hypoxic stress ([Volkenborn lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/samuelgurr/)). Dyanamic and coupled stressors along our coasts demand high-resolution responses; throughout my master's research I encouraged the academic, public, and urban architectural community to "Tell it from the heart".
   * "Bio-sensing" via real-time physiological activity (e.g. bivalve cardiac and valve gape response) can display a charasmatic perpective for water quality standardization and habitat restoration amoung urban systems. I used such concepts to transform heavy STEM topics into interactive exhibits for public education and worked as a marine consultant on architectural projects in Manhattan, New York - check out my outreach page for details ([cited in New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/nyregion/new-york-today-hudson-river-fish.html))([RiverProjectNYC](https://www.riverprojectnyc.org/visiting-research/))
