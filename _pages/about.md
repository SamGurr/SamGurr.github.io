### About
I am PhD student at Univeristy of Rhode Island in the Putnam Lab. My current research is focused on improvement of sustainable Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) aquaculture through stress conditioning under ocean acidification.

   * Estuaries and populous coasts write an ideal recipe for marine research, education, and industry to work harmoneously. I am particularly inspired by semi-sessile invertebrates that lack effective mobility to evade effects of anthropogenic activity in our modern and future coastlines.
   * Current research with Drs. Hollie Putnam (URI), Steven Roberts (UW), and Brent Vadopalas (UW) is in collaboration with the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe and Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in Washington State. Our research at the hatchery explores stress-conditioning as a viable strategy for hatchery enhancement - this is a unique oppportunity to conduct experiments in a production setting where ecophysiology and industry incentives play vital roles in experimental design and the broader applications of our findings. Pilot studies are currently developing into exciting hypothesis that expand  mulitple generations and address physiological and genetic mechanisms. More to come, stay tuned!
   * My previous grad-level research experience at Stony Brook University ([Volkenborn lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/samuelgurr/)) used non-invasive heartbeat rate sensors in-situ and in laboratory challenges as a proxy for whole animal metabolic activity of bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) under hypoxic stress ([in collab. with Drs. Fernando Lima and Rui Seabra](http://www.electricblue.eu/about/)) . I proposed a conceptual model "cardiac response to diel-cycling dissolved oxygen" (CRDDO) to explain transitions between oxyregulatory and oxyconformity under periodic exposure to coastal hypoxia and the potential non-invasive indicators of anaerobiosis ([Gurr et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098117304185)). Dynamic and coupled stressors along our coasts demand high-resolution responses; throughout my master's research I encouraged  academic, public, and  architectural communities to "Tell it from the heart".
   * Bio-sensing via real-time physiological activity can display a charasmatic perspective for water quality standardization and habitat restoration in coastal systems. I used such concepts to transform heavy STEM topics into interactive exhibits for public education and worked as a marine consultant on architectural projects in the Lower Hudson River off Manhattan, New York - check out my outreach page for details ([referenced in New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/nyregion/new-york-today-hudson-river-fish.html) and [RiverProjectNYC](https://www.riverprojectnyc.org/visiting-research/))
