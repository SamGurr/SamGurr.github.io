Experience
======
PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT:
* 2017 – present: Marine Science Consultant, NY, NY
  *	Provide scientific interpretation and expertise in biological oceanography to improve proposals, write progress reports, and organize construction plans on an architectural project in the Hudson River of Lower Manhattan
  *	Hire and train a technician to prototype and test experiments and deliverables
  *	Attend interdisciplinary discussions with teams of engineers, architects, and educators
* 2017: Biosensor Research Intern – Autodesk (The Living), 25 Broadway, NY, NY
  *	Project title: “Bio-sensing as a method for evaluating water quality”
  *	Measure ecosystem status with shellfish biosensors – design and complete several independent experiments on the physiological response of blue mussels
  *	Write conclusions in an Autodesk publication – translate data in context of IoT (internet of things) for monitoring water quality in an urban system

RESEARCH:
* 2018 – present  Research Assistant (PhD) – University of Rhode Island, South Kingston, RI
  * Project title: Development of environmental conditioning practices to decrease impacts of climate change on shellfish aquaculture; funded by FFAR
  * Conduct research at Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery (Brinnon, WA); design and complete experiments on environmental priming for advancement of shellfish production – use a network of responses (physiology, metabolism, and genetics) to assess effects of long-term, transgenerational, and repeated exposures to acidification on Pacific geoduck. Advisor: Hollie Putnam, CO-PIs: S. Roberts and B. Vadopalas
* 2015 – 2017: Research Assistant (Master’s Thesis) – Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY
  *	Thesis title: “Effects of diel-cycling hypoxia to cardiac activity and growth of   Argopecten irradians” – Advisor: Nils Volkenborn; Committee: Chris Gobler and Robert Cerrato
  *	Construct sensors and underwater equipment to measure high-resolution cardiac responses of shellfish exposed to ¬in-situ diel-cycling hypoxia and lab challenges
  *	Create a conceptual model on in-situ cardiac activity to better understand respiratory and anaerobic inferences under exposure to dynamic environmental stressors
* 2016: Long Island Water Quality Monitoring – Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY
  *	Sampled coastal sites weekly for chlorophyll, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform bacteria, turbidity, and harmful algae for the Long Island Water Quality Index program – Gobler Lab, funded by News 12. (PI: Christopher Gobler)
* 2015 – 2016:  New York Sea Grant (NYSG) Scholar – Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY
  * NYSG, Grant title: “Cardiac Responses of Benthic Invertebrates to Hypoxic Stress”
  *	Complete a novel ecophysiological study on the heartbeat rate of threatened shellfish and lead outreach events to share findings with broad audiences. (PI: Nils Volkenborn)
* 2013: Undergraduate Research Fellow – University of New Haven, West Haven, CT
  *	Project title: “Assessment of high marsh occupation by populations of the fiddler crab Uca pugnax across salt marsh systems on the CT shore” (PI: Shannon Meseck)
* 2012: Undergrad. Research Fellow – NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Milford, CT
  *	Project title: “The effects of ocean acidification and dissolved nitrogen sources on the growth and elemental stoichiometry of the marine diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Thalassiosira weissflogii” (PI: Roman Zajak)
