*It is easy to let a tough situation grow into a mental fog, it is difficult to accept change until the fog is cleared – I am glad to say that I have approached a more comfortable mind space to tell this story.*
Higher ed has thrown a series of wrenches into my journey emphasizing the importance to rethink, reach out, and readapt. I would not be the person I am today without these obstacles. The following is a short recap of a U-turn that forced me to question everything and ultimately to try again...

_*Friday, March 17, 2017 – Saint Patrick’s Day*_

“What is Ekman spiral and how is it tied to the Coriolis effect?” Hundreds of index cards were crammed in the central panel of my 2001 Civic and every red-light was a pop quiz in preparation for comprehensive exams. The one giant issue was financial support. Transfer documents were signed but stored in the office; I refused to submit for transition out of the doctorate program until the final moment. My last chance to continue lied in the hands of the coveted NSF GRFP. Decisions were made, and I was nauseous with suspense.
An honorable mention… a confidence booster for students in established well-funded labs – for me it was a one-way ticket out of grad school and the start of the roughest, yet _most informative year of my life._

_*The following year…*_

**Rethink – put strengths into perspective**
Negative mindset: “Are people like me not meant for science?”
Financial instability not a new obstacle. Socio-economic status felt like a crutch; like a trapeze artist with a safety net, it seemed that higher ed preferred an unhindered population.

In the year after finishing my master’s I kept two jobs (one science-related and one not-so-science related) to stay fresh with the subject matter I enjoyed, but feed into alternative options. Six hours in subways, trains, and city blocks over the daily commute gave a refreshing sense of independence from the academic world to recalibrate and prepare for new beginnings. I grew to understand what I want to pursue/avoid in higher education and how to craft my own experience.

**Reach out - give the dream one last chance**
Lucky enough, the first hit from a google search for “invertebrate ecophysiology” (my favorite research topic) was the lab of a new assistant professor with grad positions open in a neighboring state! Complete transparency was stressed from the get-go where I opened with prior experiences and plans moving forward. I am currently a student with this PI and extremely appreciative to be able to pursue a doctorate once more – this time to see it all the way.
**Readapt – from the Big Apple to the biggest burrowing clam**
Acceptance and another UHaul van. Home is not a place, it is my partner, dog, family, and friends. Leaving home has emphasized what I want to reinforce during this next graduate experience – communication. Gridline blocks of New York are akin to the endless fir trees that line the Olympic National Forest – from on the express 2 line downtown to the misty mountains we are all constantly _adapting_ to flourish in a new environment.
