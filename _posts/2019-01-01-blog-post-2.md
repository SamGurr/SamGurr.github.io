*It is easy to let a tough situation grow into a mental fog, it is difficult to accept change until it is lifted*

I am glad to say that I have approached a more comfortable mind space to tell this story.

Higher ed has thrown a series of wrenches into my journey emphasizing the importance to **rethink, reach out, and readapt**. I would not be the person I am today without these obstacles. The following is a short recap of a U-turn that forced me to question everything and ultimately to try again...

_Friday, March 17, 2017 – Saint Patrick’s Day_

“What is Ekman spiral and how is it tied to the Coriolis effect?” Hundreds of index cards were crammed in the central panel of my 2001 Civic and every red-light was a pop quiz in preparation for comprehensive exams. The one giant issue was financial support. Transfer documents were signed but stored in the office; I refused to submit for transition out of the doctorate program until the final moment. My last chance to continue lied in the hands of the coveted NSF GRFP. Decisions were made and I was nauseous with suspense.

An honorable mention… for some is a simple confidence booster in an established well-funded lab, for me a one-way ticket out of grad school and the start of the roughest, yet most informative, year of my life.

_The following year…_

**Rethink** – put strengths into perspective

Negative mindset: “Are people like me not meant for science?”
Financial instability was not a new obstacle. Socio-economic status felt like a crutch throughout my initial experience in grad school; like a trapeze artist with a safety net, it seemed that higher ed preferred an unhindered population. I was isolated.

In the year after finishing my master’s I kept two jobs (one related to science and one not so much) to stay fresh with the subject matter I enjoyed and try alternative options. Six hours in subways, trains, and city blocks over the daily commute gave me a refreshing sense of independence from the academic world to recalibrate and prepare for new beginnings. I grew to understand what I want to pursue/avoid in higher education and how to craft my own experience.

**Reach out** - give the dream one last chance

Lucky enough, the first hit from a google search for “invertebrate ecophysiology” (my favorite research topic) was the lab of a new assistant professor with grad positions open in a neighboring state! Complete transparency was introduced from the get-go. I am currently a student with this PI and extremely appreciative to be able to pursue a doctorate once more – this time with the funding to see it all the way.

**Readapt** – from the Big Apple to the biggest burrowing clam

Acceptance and another UHaul van. Home is not a place, it is my partner, dog, family, and friends. Leaving home has emphasized what I want to reinforce during this next graduate experience – communication.

From on the express 2 line of downtown NYC to the misty mountains of endless fir trees of Olympic National Forest, life has presented a constant need to _adapt and acclimate_ to new obstacles and environments.

Sure my journey has been anything but linear, but the **growth along the way defines who I am.**
