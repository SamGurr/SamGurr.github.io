### _What are these figures/cartoons?_

### **Experiment details:**
**Location:** Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery - Brinnon, Washington, USA

**Objective** Condition postlarval pacific geoduck for three months under ambient and elevated pCO2 conditions to measure **_physiological, cellular, and molecular_** response under subseqent stress encounters.

_HYPOTHESIS_: **Moderate stress conditioning enhances intragenerational resliance and performance (acclimitization) to under subsequent stress encounters of similar or greater intensity**

_SYNTHESIS/BROADER_IMPACT_: Our research completed in a production setting has direct implications for sustainable food supply and economic viability of local goods and services under the Anthropocene. Intragenerational effects of stress exposure for the benefit of subsequent encounters presents a charasmatic rendition of, "what does not kill you makes you stronger". A holistic mechanism including thresholds of oxidative stress, differential DNA methylation, and mitchondrial homoestatis are at the foreground in our current work.

*  Our experiment used 120,000 pediverliger geoduck for a total of three exposure periods and 12 total treatments! We measured respiration rate and growth and fixed animals periodically for cellular and molecular responses.

* Early-life _p_ CO<sub>2</sub> conditioning had a significant effect of antioxidant capacity and biomass _regardless_ of subsequent exposure(s)! (hover over figures for unique caption)
