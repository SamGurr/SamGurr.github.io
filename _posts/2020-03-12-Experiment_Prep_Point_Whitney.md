The following is a summary of a trip to Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in Brinnon, Washingston frmo 3/6/20 - 3/13/20.

## About the trip..
Prepare heathstack for 8-month rearing trial starting from 30-day-old pediveliger (setter) stage well in to juvenile development.

- Experiment will contain **three main _立_<sub>aragonite.sat</sub> treatments controled in *triplicate***

  (1) ambient _p_CO<sub>2</sub> = _立_<sub>aragonite.sat</sub> > 1; pH<sub>t.s.</sub> 7.8-7.9;

  (2) moderate elevated _p_CO<sub>2</sub> = _立_<sub>aragonite.sat</sub> 0.4; pH<sub>t.s.</sub> 7.4;

  (3) severe elevated _p_CO<sub>2</sub> = _立_<sub>aragonite.sat</sub> 0.1-0.2; pH<sub>t.s.</sub> 7.1;

- Continuous live algae feed and isolated seawater flow per replicate tank/tray

## Heathstack up and running

- nine trays total each fed by a conical sump for three total _p_CO<sub>2</sub> treatments

## Algae plan

- the broodstock are fed from a continuous flow of live low density culture from the greenhouse
- a flow switch in the feed conical prevents pumps from burning
- *our plan* discussed with Mat that 400 - 600 L will be possible per day to add to this conical. This equates a rate of 1/2 GPH for each heathtray

## Reciprocal treatment transition

- Experiment will contain two periods (months 2 and 4) when animals will be divided and allocated to different treatments to address the effects of stress priming on subsequent encounters
- review "2020-03-12_8_month_OA_Experiment_Plan" for further details
- replication will require custom tanks with trays acting as a water. It is critical that seawater is not exchanged between tanks

## Scope for Growth build
- **P** = [***C*** - (***R*** + ***U***)]
    - ***R*** respiration rate: measured with SDR dish at the hatchery; freeze all animals in -20C for AFDW as loss of ignition in Putnam Lab
    - ***U*** ammonia excretion: freeze water samples from respiration rate measurements (~3-4 ml individual<sup>-1</sup>) for later analysis
    - ***C*** ingestion rate and absportion efficiency:

- For ingestion rate & absortion efficency, it is critical that sw+seston is homogenous for Nexcelom Cellometer readings pre and post incubation. The animal(s) will also need to be suspended on a platform to avoid disturbance from the magnetic stir bar below.
