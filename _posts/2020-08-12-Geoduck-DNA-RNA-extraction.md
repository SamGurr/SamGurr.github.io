### Geoduck Homogenization

> - Modifications and notes in addition to K.Wong's tests [link here](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-07-30-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-and-Geoduck.md) written below in <span style="color:red"> **RED** </span>
- I also **BOLD** text to emphasize transition of samples/reagents to new or different receptacles, this will help me streamline equipment prep in future extractions

1. Removed samples from -80 &deg;C.
2. Add 1 mL of RNA/DNA shield
3. Add 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads to each tube (**the same tube from the -80 &deg;C**)
4. Vortex for <span style="color:red"> one </span> minute. Leave the settings on and on max power.
  - <span style="color:red"> Note: must insert the tubes firmly in the vortex or they will fly out. **Hover a hand *lightly* over the samples to prevent this** </span>
  - <span style="color:red"> Sample 282 flew out of the vortex and the sample was lost. The remaining processing occuring for samples 219 and 234 **only** </span>
5. Remove supernatant from the bead tube and place in **a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube** labeled on the side with the extraction sample number and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the sample number. This supernatant will become the sample for "soft homogenization".
  - <span style="color:red"> 300 μl of supernatant was taken to avoid beads and geoduck shell/tissue </span>
  - <span style="color:red"> Note: attempt to retain more supertatant in future extractions. I vortexed for a shorter period of time here (one minute) to attempt to increase the quality of DNA in downstream analysis </span>
6. **In a new microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml)** add  <span style="color:red"> 300 </span> μl of sample, <span style="color:red"> 30 </span> μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and <span style="color:red"> 15 </span> μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
  - <span style="color:red"> Important!
    - **Proteinase K does not come with the zymo kit** find this in the -20&deg;C
  - <span style="color:red"> summary:
      - **10:1** for Sample:proteinase K digestion buffer
      - **2:1** for proteinase K digestion buffer:Proteinase K </span>
      - the volume(s) here depends on the amount of supernantant taken after soft homogenization
7. Vortex and spin down all tubes.
8. Trasfer <span style="color:red"> *### μl* </span> of superatant to a new 5 mL tube.
  - <span style="color:red"> **Important** '*### μl*' depends on the volume of supernatant taken in step #5
    - today I was able to take **300 μl** - this has important infleunce on the volumes used below... </span>

#### **DNA Extraction**
1. Set up **yellow DNA spin columns** and collection tubes, label appropriately
  - **n = 1 yellow spin column per sample**
2. Warm elution liquids to 70 &deg;C (10mM Tris HCl pH. 8.0 and RNase free water)
  - <span style="color:red"> Use a Thermomixer to keep the two samples warmed
  - <span style="color:red"> Note: thes solutions are used as the **final steps** for DNA extraction (Tris) and RNA extraction (RNAse free water)
    - <span style="color:red"> **How much 10nM Tris?**
      - n * 100 µl Tris == volume needed (review steps # 18 and 21)
      - today... 2 * 100 µl  == 200 µl Tris </span>
    - <span style="color:red"> **How much RNase free water?**
      - n * 100 µl Tris == volume needed (review steps # 18 and 21)
      - today... 2 * 100 µl  == 200 µl RNase free water </span>
3. Add equal volume (to supernatant; <span style="color:red"> ### µl </span>) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each sample tube
  - <span style="color:red"> ' ### µl' depends on # 8 in 'Geoduck Homogenization' </span>
4. Finger flick to mix tubes
5. Add <span style="color:red"> half of the total volume of sample </span> gently to the yellow DNA spin column
6. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
7. **Important if running RNA extraction!** Save the flow through from this step: transfer to **a new 5 mL tube** labeled for RNA
  - Repeat steps 5-7 until all volume is gone. (i.e. x 2)
  - Example: if total volume was 1400 µl, you would run steps 5-7 twice with 700 µl each run
  - <span style="color:red"> Total volume today was 600 µl; this volume will double in RNA extractions below (add equal volume EtOH) **today I used 1.5 ml tube here because of the low volume of supernantat retained post-homogenization**. </span>
8. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
9. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
10. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
11. Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
12. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
13. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
14. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
15. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
16. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
17. Transfer yellow columns to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes ("E1")
18. Add 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter
19. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds **keep the flow through**
21. Add another 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter
22. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
23. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
24. Throw away filter and **keep flow through**.
24. Aliquot 10 µl of the elution to **0.5 mL PCR tubes** for Qubit and Gel Electrophoresis analysis.
  - n = 1 tube per sample
25. Store at 4 &deg;C if quantifying the same day or the next, if waiting longer store in -20 &deg;C freezer.

#### **RNA Extraction**
*Can do concurrently with DNA Extraction after DNA Extraction Step 7*
1. Add equal volume (<span style="color:red"> Total volume today was 600 µl - review step # 7 </span>) 100% EtOH to the tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through

> <span style="color:red"> Note: Tube size used today was 1.5 ml to hold the 1200 µl total volume after this step. If/when more supernatant is taken (# 5 in 'Geoduck Homogenization'), you will require a 5ml tube in step # 7 of 'DNA extraction'! </span>

2. Vortex and spin down to mix
3. Add 700 µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns
4. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
5. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
6. Add 700 µl to the green RNA spin columns (the rest from the 1.5mL RNA tubes)
7. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
    - Repeat until all volume is gone (i.e. x 4)
    - Get DNase I from freezer

> <span style="color:red"> Note: steps # 3- 7 were written assuming 2800 µl total volume after step 1. Today I had 1200 µl total volume after step 1 so I ran this X 2 for 600 µl each run.

8. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
9. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to each green RNA column
10. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
11. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
12. Make DNase I treatment master mix:
    - 75µl DNA Digestion buffer x # of samples
    - 5µl DNase I x # of samples

> Today I had 2 samples, therefore: 150 µl of DNA Digestion buffer and 10 µl of DNase I

13. Add 80 µl DNase I treatment master mix directly to the filter of the green RNA columns
14. Incubate at room temp for 15 minutes
15. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to each column
16. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
17. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
18. Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the green RNA spin columns
19. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
20. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
21. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the green RNA spin columns
22. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
23. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
24. Transfer green columns to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
25. Add 50 µl warmed DNase/RNase free water to each green RNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter
26. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
27. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
28. Repeat steps 25-27 for a final elution volume of 100 µl
29. Aliquot 5 µl of the final elution to **0.5 mL PCR tubes** for Qubit and TapeStation analysis.
   - n = 1 tube per sample
30. Store all tubes in the -80 &deg;C freezer.

## Clean-up
1. Place tissue and liquid in the waste container labeled Zymo extraction waste.
2. Wipe down RNA free area with RNase away and kimwipes.
3. Throw away all tips and restock tip boxes if necessary.
