# **Objective(s):**
- Prepare geoduck metabolomic samples for analysis following the follwoing links:
  - [K.Wong's prep for coral](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/) + [Modified for geoduck](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-08-12-Geoduck-metabolomics-extraction.md)
- Six samples were prepped on 8/11/20 for 1 animal and 4 animals in triplicate [view table here](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-08-12-Geoduck-metabolomics-extraction.md) - today I will prep three additional samples with 7 animals each **final table at the end of this post**


## Extraction Protocol, important links (MSDS info), etc. [link here](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-08-12-Geoduck-metabolomics-extraction.md)

## Notes during today's extraction

- I initially targetted 10 animals in triplicate, however this is reduced to 7 animals per sample. Our whole geoduck have a broad size variation and some individuals are quite large. These samples are very concentrated and completely fill the glass dounce during homogenization.
- **Notes on the protocol** IMPORTANT!!
  - 5 ml tube used for the initial weight measurements (vial, vial + buffer, vial + buffer + geoduck)
  - Transfer from tube->dounce was modified to reduce potential error and contact with the buffer. **use 1 ml pipette to transfer buffer and use a pipette tip to carefully transfer animals to the dounce.**
