## PROTOCOL: DNA/RNA Extractions of *P. generosa* samples

 **READ.me**

This protocol was recently revised for testing geoduck samples ([link 1](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-08-12-Geoduck-DNA-RNA-extraction.md) and [link 2](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-07-30-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-and-Geoduck.md)) modified from successful extractions of coral tissue [link here](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Trial-1/).

## Prep lab space

*Set your space with the following...*

> *N* = the number of samples you are running today

- *N* × 1
  - yellow spin columns (DNA)
  - green spin columns (RNA)
    - both yellow and green spin columns inserted in flow-through tubes
    - lid  ==  sample ID and either 'D' or 'R'
- *N* × 2
  - 1.5 ml epindorf tubes labelled for (1) DNA and (2) RNA;
    - lid  ==  sample ID and either 'D' or 'R'
    - tube == sample ID, 'DNA' or 'RNA', date of extraction, and initials (i.e. 852 DNA 20200818 SG)
  - 5 ml tubes labelled for (1) DNA and (2) RNA
    - lid  ==  sample ID and either 'D' or 'R'
- *N* / 2
  - glass microbead vials
    - Note: each microbead vial contains ~0.5 ml and 0.25 ml is used to homogenize each geoduck sample
- Zymo waste container (i.e. labelled glass beaker, 50 ml)

- Warm the elution liquids to 70 °C for the DNA (10 mM Tris) and RNA extractions (RNAse free water)
    - How much 10mM Tris?
      - *N* × 100 µl
    - How much RNase free water?
      - *N* × 100 µl

  - Use a Thermomixer to keep the two samples warm

## Geoduck Homogenization

1. Remove samples from -80 &deg;C - samples are whole juvenile geoduck with one animal per 1.5 ml screw cap tube.
2. Add 1 mL of RNA/DNA shield to each
3. Add 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads to each tube (add to the same tube from the -80 &deg;C)
4. Vortex for one minute. Leave the settings on and at mid-max power.
  - **Important**: The one minute at max power is only for large individuals of >8mm shell length - these individuals are tightly fit into the 1.5 ml screw cap tubes. Smaller indivuals (~ 3- 5mm shell length) should be vortexed for a shorter duration or lower power.
  - **Note**: must insert the tubes firmly in the vortex or they will fly out. Hover a hand *lightly* over the samples.
5. Spin down all tubes to reduce the bubbles and move large tissue fragments and/or suspended glass beads to the bottom of the vial
6. Observe the samples - Is the supernatant clear without large fragments of suspended tissue?

  - If yes, proceed to step 8

  - If no, proceed to step 7

7. You answered no the #6 meaning supernatant transfer is not possible without transfering suspended tissue fragment(s). Spin this tube down again and observe, if it is possible to take the supernantant (~700ul) without transferring tissue proceed to step 8. Alternatively, take what you can of this tube and transfer to a new labelled 1.5 ml epindorf tube - spin the tube down. Now you should be able to proceed to step 8.

8. In a new labelled 1.5 ml tube, add the following:
  - **supernatant of sample**
    - i.e. 700 ul
  - **Proteinase K digestion buffer**: add 1:10 of Proteinase K digestion buffer : supernatant
    - i.e. add 70 ul Proteinase K digestion buffer if you previously added 700 ul of supernatant
  - **Proteinase K**: add 1:2 of Proteinase K : Proteinase K digestion buffer
      - i.e. add 35 ul Proteinase K if you previously added 70 ul Proteinase K digestion buffer
9. Vortex and spin down all tubes.
10. Transfer supernatant to a new 5 mL tube.
  - **Important**: this volume depends on the volume taken in step #8
    - i.e. if you added 700 ul of supernatant in step 8 (along with proteinase reagents), you will be able to transfer 800 ul here in step 10.

## Extraction: Zymo Research Quick-DNA/RNA MiniPrep Plus Kit

### **DNA Extraction of Geoduck Samples**
1. Set up yellow DNA spin columns and collection tubes, label appropriately
  - *N* = 1 yellow spin column per sample

2. **Add DNA/RNA lysis buffer** in equal volume to supernatant (in 5ml tube)
  - i.e. 800 ul DNA/RNA lysis buffer added if 800 ul were transfered in step #8 in 'Geoduck Homogenization'

3. Finger flick to mix tubes

4. **Add half of the total volume of sample** gently to the yellow DNA spin column

  4a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

  4b. **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH for RNA extractions!** from this step: transfer to a new 5 mL tube labeled for RNA extractions

NOTE:  Repeat steps 5-7 until all volume is gone. (i.e. x 2)

  - i.e. if total volume was 1600 µl, you would run steps 5-7 twice with 800 µl each run

  - **record the total volume of you transfered for RNA!**

5. **Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer** gently to the yellow DNA spin columns

  5a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

  5b. **Discard** flow through (Zymo kit waste)

6. **Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** gently to the yellow DNA spin columns

  6a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

  6b. **Discard** flow through (Zymo kit waste)

7. **Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns

  7a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**

  7b. **Discard** flow through (Zymo kit waste)

8. **Transfer** yellow columns to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes

9. **Add 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl** to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter

  9a. Incubate at room temperature for **5 minutes**. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds **keep the flow through**

10. **Add another 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl** to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter

  10a. Incubate at room temperature for **15 minutes**. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds. Throw away filter and **keep flow through**.

14. For QC... **Aliquot 10 µl of the elution to 0.5 mL PCR tubes** for Qubit and Gel Electrophoresis analysis.
  - *N* = 1 tube per sample

15. Storage:
  - QC aliquots: store at 4 &deg;C if quantifying the same day or the next
  - Whole extractions and QC aliquots: store at -20 &deg;C if waiting longer

### **RNA Extraction of Geoduck Samples**

1. **Add equal volume 100% EtOH** to the tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through
  - i.e. 1600 ul 100% EtOH added if 1600 ul were transfered in step #4 in 'DNA Extractionof Geoduck Samples'
  - Note: Review # 4 in 'DNA Extraction'. You should have the total volume that you transferred from the spin column in this step.

2. Vortex and spin down to mix

3. **Add 1/4 of the total volume** to the green RNA spin columns
  - i.e. if the total volume was 1600 ul then add 800 ul here

  3a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

  3b. **Discard** flow through (Zymo kit waste)

4. Repeat step 3 until all volume is gone (i.e. x 4)
    - Note: get the DNase I from the -20&deg;C

5. **Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** gently to each green RNA column

  5a. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

  5b. **Discard** flow through (Zymo kit waste)

6. **Make DNase I treatment master mix**:
    - *N* × 75µl DNA Digestion buffer
    - *N* × 5µl DNase I

*N* | DNA Digestion buffer | DNase I
---| --- |---
1  |  75 |  5
3  | 225  |  15
5  |  375 |  25
