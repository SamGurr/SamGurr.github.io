#### **Objective:**

Repeat Qubit for **sample 350**
- originally extracted on [20200826](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/20200826-Juvenile-Panopea-generosa-DNA-RNA-Extractions/) and QC was completed on [20200827](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/20200827-Juvenile-Panopea-generosa-DNA-RNA-Extractions/) showing no DNA or RNA

Complete TapeStation for **samples 1632 and 1576**
- sample 1576 was originally extracted and QC on [20200827](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/20200827-Juvenile-Panopea-generosa-DNA-RNA-Extractions/) was a low  [Tapestation signal ](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/2020-08-27%20-%2016.55.16.pdf)
- sample 1632 was originally completed on [20200923](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/20200923-Juvenile-Panopea-generosa-DNA-RNA-Extractions/) and the Tapestation was not completed due to a poor Qubit signal.

### Qubit Results (sample 350)
----------

- low DNA and very high RNA! A high signal like what was detected in ![Tapestation](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/2020-08-27%20-%2016.55.16.pdf) on 20200827
