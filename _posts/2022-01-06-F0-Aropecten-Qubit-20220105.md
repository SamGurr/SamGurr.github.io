#### **Objective and summary:**
- Measure DNA concentrations of DNA extracted from F0 adult Bay scallop adductor tissue (dissected and extracted in early January 2022)
- DNA was extracted using the OMEGA EZNA Tissue kit protocol [here](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/Airradians-adult-DNA-extractions/)
- Ran Qubit dsDNA BR kit following standard protocol [thermosci online pdf](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf)

### Changes/Recommendations to the OMGEA Extraction protocol!
**NOTE:** The previous extractions in late December 2021 and January 2022 resulted in low DNA yield via qubit (review table in F0 Aropecten Qubit 20220104) *therefore* I made a few changes and paid close attention to particular aspects of the protocol

##### (1) Supernatant after overnight proteinase K incubation...
- the pellet is light and not static, protocol reads to avoid the solid pellet - seems to potentially clog the spin column? Due to its consistency  it is very difficult to not suspend the pellet upon pipetting the supernatant
- summary of the issue: low DNA yield likely due to clogged spin column - I have been pipetting ~200ul at this step.
- possible solution: take less volume of the supernatant to conservatively avoid the pellet in future extractions, see if this changes the yield

##### (2) Cold ethanol
- **Note** the following change was made for the extraction quantified below
- 100% Ethanol is kept in the ethanol fridge and is added after a 70C incubation period - perhaps the cold temperature after incubation can present issues here
- possible solution (completed today): allocate the necessary volume **before** extracting to allow the ethanol sample to arrive to room temperature

##### (3) Warm elution Buffer
- **Note** the following change was made for the extraction quantified below
- Elution buffer is incubated at 70C for the entire extraction duration and is use twice to elute the DNA, in previous extractions I left this small volume out on the benchtop incubation and spin down as opposed to putting back at 70C IncuShaker
- possible solution (completed today): place the elution buffer **back to the 70C IncuShaker** as the samples incubate on the benchtop to ensure buffer is at the recommended temperature
