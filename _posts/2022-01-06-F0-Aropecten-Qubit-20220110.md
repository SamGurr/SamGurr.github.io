#### **Objective and summary:**
- Measure DNA concentrations of DNA extracted from F0 adult Bay scallop adductor tissue (dissected and extracted in early January 2022)
- DNA was extracted using the OMEGA EZNA Tissue kit protocol [here](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/Airradians-adult-DNA-extractions/)
- Ran Qubit dsDNA BR kit following standard protocol [thermosci online pdf](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf)

### Changes/Recommendations to the OMGEA Extraction protocol!
**NOTE:** The previous extractions in late December 2021 and January 2022 resulted in low DNA yield via qubit (review table in F0 Aropecten Qubit 20220104) *therefore* I made a few changes and paid close attention to particular aspects of the protocol

##### Supernatant after overnight proteinase K incubation...
- used spin columns after the overnight incubation to potentiallu catch the loose tissue pellet. This worked - spin column was discarded and I took the 200ul sample 
- the rationale here was that I may have been taking p some of the pellet and it clogged the spin column downstream, decreasing yield, **however this did not increase our yield!**

### Qubit Results

| Sample        | DNA (ng/uL)  |           |  
| ------        | -----------  |       -   |

| Standard 1 	|    92.66     |    95.12  |     
| Standard 2 	|   10572.79   |   10362.27|

| 5         	|     1.32     |     1.25  |     
| 9         	|     10.9     |     11.1  |      


### Moving forward...

- as we see here I made several adjustments to no avail (DNA yield still low)
- next extractions I will do the following: 
	
##### (1) Use more tissue 
- the protocol (OMEGE EZNA) asks for 30 mg of tissue and I have been following this - double the tissue and proteinase K to see if this increases DNA 

##### (2) Decrease volume of Elution Buffer 
- use 2 elutions at 50 ul each as opposed to 100 ul. This should at least double our possible DNA concentration - our main bottleneck for library prep is concentration of DNA and not total DNA so highly concentrated low volume is perfect
