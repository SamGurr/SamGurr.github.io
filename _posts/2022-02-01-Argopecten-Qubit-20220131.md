#### **Objective and summary:**
- Complete extraction and qubit quantification using non-target adult scallop samples 
	
	- 30 mg and 90 mg of tissue 
	- 3 hr Proteinase K incubation at 120 RPM and 55C - vortexed every hour
	- doubled the volume of TL Buffer, HBC buffer and 100% ethanol for the 60 mg samples (**did not double proteinase K**) 

- DNA was extracted using the OMEGA EZNA Tissue kit protocol [here](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/Airradians-adult-DNA-extractions/)
- Ran Qubit dsDNA BR kit following standard protocol [thermosci online pdf](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf)

### Moving forward...

- as we see here... **the overnight 55C incubation in previous DNA extractions is the likley culprit!**
- we also 
- for te next extractions...
	
##### (1) Use more tissue 
- the protocol (OMEGE EZNA) asks for 30 mg of tissue and I have been following this - double the tissue and proteinase K to see if this increases DNA 

##### (2) Decrease volume of Elution Buffer 
- use 2 elutions at 50 ul each as opposed to 100 ul. This should at least double our possible DNA concentration - our main bottleneck for library prep is concentration of DNA and not total DNA so highly concentrated low volume is perfect
