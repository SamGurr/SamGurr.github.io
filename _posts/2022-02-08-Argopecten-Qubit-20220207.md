#### **Objective and summary:**

- **REDO** complete extraction and qubit quantification using ** ethanol-fixed adductor muscle tissue of target scallops**
	
	- 60 mg of tissue 
	- 3 hr Proteinase K incubation at 120 RPM and 55C - vortexed every hour
	- doubled the volume of TL Buffer, HBC buffer and 100% ethanol for the 60 mg samples (**did not double proteinase K**) 
	- of the 18 target F0 adult scallops extracted (all spawned 7/26/22) =, 17 were extracted again to attempt to yield higher DNA yield (all but ID#9)

- DNA was extracted using the OMEGA EZNA Tissue kit protocol [here](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/Airradians-adult-DNA-extractions/)
- Ran Qubit dsDNA BR kit following standard protocol [thermosci online pdf](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf)

**Check previous Qubit notebook posts** to see if what I did today increased our yield. 
Oddly there is not an expected high difference (i.e. upwards of 40-80 ng/ul in previous test) but 
I can somewhat confirm now that this the nature of our samples. 

**moving forward with lcWGS library prep?** we need 2.5 ng/ul DNA to start Nina's protocol, this Qubit run looks OK
