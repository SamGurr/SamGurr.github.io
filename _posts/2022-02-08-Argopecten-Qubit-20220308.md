| Sample        | DNA (ng/uL)  |             |  
| ------        | -----------  | ----------- |  
|               |    RUN 1     |    RUN 2    |      
| Standard      |    57.20     |    58.26    |     
| Standard  	|    1182.24   |    1204.28  |     
| Low A 1    	|     81.4 *   |    81.6 *   |     
| Low B 1  	  	|     54       |    54.0     |       
| High A 1  	|     82.0 *   |    82.2 *   |     

 
'Low' represents the low pCO2 treatment (higher pH) 
'High' represents the high pCO2 treatment (low pH)

asterisk (*) represents samples that initially read as 'too high' in concentration. 
Each was diluted 2:1 with ultra pure water and the actual value of the sample is given above (raw value from Qubit x 2)
