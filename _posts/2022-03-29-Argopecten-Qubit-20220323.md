'Low' represents the low pCO2 treatment (higher pH) 
'High' represents the high pCO2 treatment (low pH)

asterisk (*) represents samples that initially read as 'too high' in concentration. 
Each was diluted 2:1 with ultra pure water and the actual value of the sample is given above (raw value from Qubit x 2)
