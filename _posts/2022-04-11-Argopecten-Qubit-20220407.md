#### **Objective and summary:**

- RNA extractions of juvenile *A. irradians* from OA challenge 

- scallops extracted today were fixed in RNAlater alongside a physiological suite on 10/27/21

- NOTE 1: I am targetting 10 samples per treatment (8 and 7.5) on each date (10/27/21 and 2/28/22) 
for TagSeq. On 20220406 there were 4 samples with low yield, two from pH 8 and two from pH 7.5. 
I ran additional samples here with hope to get higher yield. 

- NOTE 2: 4 extractions were completed for Molly's Solidissima samples (surf clams) and are labelled as 'M1, M2,.. etc'. 

### Qubit Results

----------

| Sample        | DNA (ng/uL)  |             |  
| ------        | -----------  | ----------- |  
|               |    RUN 1     |    RUN 2    |      
| Standard      |    59.98     |    60.15    |     
| Standard  	|    1142.68   |    1156.69  |     
| M 1        	|     87.4     |    85.0     |     
| M 2  	    	|     93.0     |    90.0     |       
| M 3  	    	|     4.45     |    4.36     |
| M 5    	    |     79.0     |    77.0     |    
| 8 A 3  	  	|     48.3     |    46.9     |  
| 8 D 3      	|     45.1     |    44.8     |     
| 7.5 C 3  		|     26.8     |    27.0     |
| 7.5 D 3    	|     26.2     |    26.7     |     

'8' represents the low pCO2 treatment (higher pH) 
'7.5' represents the high pCO2 treatment (low pH)

'**' represents samples with low ng/ul yield - additional samples from these treatments 
were repeated to achieve a total of 10 samples per treatment (8 and 7.5) for TagSeq
