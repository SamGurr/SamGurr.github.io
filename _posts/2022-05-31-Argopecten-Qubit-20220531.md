#### **Objective and summary:**

- DNA extractions of juvenile *A. irradians* from October 25th 2021; 
objective is to use these extractions for lcWGS sequencing for GWAS, SNP calling, etc. 
alonside the parentage of F0s extracted for the same seq 

- an online checklist can be found [here]{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHM3u-njPWcJWpEaOIGDrHUU3swhVPZvZRTKvVuSV1Q/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=108372819286763574086}

### Qubit Results (dsDNA BR assay kit)

* NOTE: has several issues running the standards for the dsDNA BR assay kit (was a little rusty I guess) 
I opened a fresh 500 assay kit to diagnose this error and concluded that the reagent (or dye) must be thawed nearly completely 
and perhaps vortexed/spun down to receive a workable sample w/o error downstream - in summary the 'old' kit opened in January 2021 should 
still work fine
