### Objective and summary:
----------

- Run [ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-01-18-Gel-Electrophoresis-with-ethidium-bromide.md)

- Note: ran with a 1.5% agarose gel 100 mV for 60 minutes

- review Qubit for these extractions on [20220531](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-05-31-Argopecten-Qubit-20220531)

### Gel Electrophoresis
----------

**Gel map is as follows:**

- '**raw**' refers to the samples run as direct aliquots of the DNA extraction using (attachd protocol here)

- '**I**' refers to the Illumina DNA Prep protocol as suggested by manufacturers *using all Illumina materials* with 500 ng DNA samples (SOP here)[https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-06-03-Illumina-DNA-Prep-SOP]

- '**I+N**' refers to the Illumina DNA Prep protocol for tagmentation *only* alongside amplification and cleanup using KAPA HiFi ReadyStart Mix and Ampure Beads w/tris resuspension as 
recommended by Nina's modified Baym protocol (SOP here)[https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-06-03-Illumina-DNA-Prep-with-KAPA-and-Ampure-SOP]

	* note this modified Baym prtocol calls for samples between 1-10ng (ideally 2.5) whereas I ran these as 500 ng to directly compare to the full Illumina - we will see if using the same reagent volumes (i.e. KAPA and Ampure beads) presents any red flags

* we see strong high molecular weight bands for the raw and **no bands for the post-library prep samples** 

* I read (here[https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/05/library-quantification-and-quality-control-quick-reference-guide.html] that 
the proper quality check for libraries from Illumina DNA Prep (& previous Nextera reagnets) is Quantification via Qubit and Quality control with a BioAnalyzer 


**Qubit quanitification** 
----------

* followed-up up with Qubit and yielded **'Too Low' - no DNA present** 



### What happened / what can I change? 
----------

**Note:** Since library prep was run two different ways,  it appears that the culprit lies in what was common between both SOPs (at least this is a good first step..)
Common between both SOPs is the tagmentation and post-tagmentation clean-up and the use of the thermocycler. 

* Tagment wash buffer

	- *What happened?* -- A tip on the Illumina site emphasises that the Tagment Wash Buffer *must be pipetted directly onto the beads* where I simply added 
	the wash buffer to fill during the wash steps.

	- *What can I change?* -- Adding directly should disperse the beads from the magnet breifly, whether this will do the trick? Time will tell!

* PCR and thermocycler step(s)

	- *What happened?* -- After reading through the protocol, all steps were completed correctly (or my best try in doing so). The only hiccup 
was in loading the thermocycler with the PCR plate - I noticed the plastic plate was quite warm after each step in the thermocycler, this was a mistake. 

	- *What can I change?* -- Next library prep attempt, load pcr tubes/96 well plate directly on the wells in the thermocycler to allow proper annealing temp and cooling for PCR amplification.
	These tubes/wells have thin walls created jsut for this purpose - improper loading of your sample to the thermocycler (i.e. within a loading plate) does not allow the tube/sample to be properly 
	inserted in the thermocycler leading to error in temperature change
