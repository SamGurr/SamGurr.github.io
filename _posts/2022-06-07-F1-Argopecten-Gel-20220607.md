### Objective and summary:
----------
- Run [ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis](https://samgurr.github.io/protocols/2022/01/18/Gel-Electrophoresis-with-ethidium-bromide.html)
for post-library prep samples F1 Juvenile Bay SCallop 8B 51 and 8B 52

	* NOTE:	 I ran library prep  and quantification tests for 8A1 and 8A2 yesterday and exhausted all extracted DNA from these samples. I also followed up with Qubit quantifcation postlibrary prep
	today along with Qubit for the raw sample 851, exhausted the remander of the extracted DNA for this sample

- Note: ran with a 1.5% agarose gel 100 mV for 60 minutes

### Gel Electrophoresis
----------

**Gel map is as follows:**

- '**raw**' refers to the samples run as direct aliquots of the DNA extraction using [OMEGA EZNA extraction protocol here](https://github.com/SamGur/blob/master/_posts/2021-12-21-Airradians-adult-DNA-extractions.md). Thus the sample **'raw 8B 52' is a positive control**

- '**I**' refers to the Illumina DNA Prep protocol as suggested by manufacturers *using all Illumina materials* with 500 ng DNA samples [SOP here](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-06-03-Illumina-DNA-Prep-SOP)

- '**8A 1 I**' refers to the Illumina DNA Prep protocol for library prep of sample 8A found [here](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/processing/2022/06/06/F1-Argopecten-Gel-20220606.html).
We did not find a Qubit nor a gel reading, so the sample **'8A 1 I' is a negative control**

* we see strong high molecular weight band for the raw and **a faint smear for bands in wells 3 and 4 (post library prep from today)**
These show a length of ~800-900 bp

### Summary
----------

Takeaways from using Illumina DNA Prep library prep

* 500 ng input DNA yielded ~ 3.6 ng / ul output in 30 ul (~108 ng)
* size is roughly 800-900 bp in length
* adjustments to 6/6/2022 worked

- next step: (1) check whether this 5x decrease in DNA input is to be expected (2) also check whether this size range is to be expected
