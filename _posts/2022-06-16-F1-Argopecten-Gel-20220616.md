### Objective and summary:
----------
- Run [ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis](https://github.com/SamGurr/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-01-18-Gel-Electrophoresis-with-ethidium-bromide.md)
for post-library prep samples F1 Juvenile Bay Scallop 8C 101 and 102

- Library prep was (for the first time thus far) the full 'modified Baym' protocol (site here - to be written up in a notebook post)

- Note: ran with a 1% agarose gel (0.75 g agargose 75 mL TAE) for 100 mV for 60 minutes

### Gel Electrophoresis

### Summary
----------

Takeaways from using the Modified Baym protocol

* 2.5 ng of input DNA yielded 32 ul of a final volume averaged ~15 ng/ul (~480 ng total DNA!) - this protocol worked great, better than Illumina DNA Prep recommendations!
* aside from the major aspects changed from Ilumina DNA Prep (tagmentation, amplification, clean up reagents, volumnes, input DNA, etc.) I inserted a 'hold' temp in the thermocycler 
at the same temp to the start for each program (i.e. 72C start of the PCR program, set a 'hold' at 72C prior and begin this program ~5 minutes before loading samples); 
perhaps this made the difference in our PCR?

- next step: trudge through extractions, I am ready to get this going in bulk. waiting on plate centrifuge to ensure proper protocols and spin downs of indices
