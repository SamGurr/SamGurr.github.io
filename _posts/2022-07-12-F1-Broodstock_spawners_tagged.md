## Objective and summary:
----------
- Tag all F1 broodstock scallops that were used to spawn on July 6th

- NOTE: scallops whose gametes were kept for controlled fertilizations were given a numeric tag (small orange bee tag) - the same number as the individual recorded during spawning. Although
the offpsring did not survive (Vibrio outbreak in algae culture), these tags can provide critical information if/when we reattempt with these individuals

- Tag scheme as the following:

| Treatment  | Spawned (Y/N) |Tag color     |   Notes                 |  
| ------     | -----------   | -----------  |  ----------             |
| pH 8       | Y             |    blue      |  additional numeric tag |
| pH 8       | N             |    blue      |                         |
| pH 7.5     | Y             |    yellow    |  additional numeric tag |
| pH 7.5     | N             |    yellow    |                         |
