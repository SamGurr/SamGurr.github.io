### Objective:
Bleed a few extra scallops (hatchery in the basement) from the F1 common garden culls ealier this year. Test SYBR green and JC-10 in hemolymph using the [protocol](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/protocol/2022/03/15/Hemolymph-physiology-flow-cytometry-protocol.html) written earlier this year.

#### To do:

Again, the protocol has all the info one may need to go about this testing - [check it out!](https://samgurr.github.io/SamJGurr_Lab_Notebook/protocol/2022/03/15/Hemolymph-physiology-flow-cytometry-protocol.html)

* Beforehand... (day prior)
  * filter seawater to 22um as your sheath (FSW)
  * gather materials
    * syringe
    * needle(s)
    * ice and ice box
    * flow cytometry ('FC') tubes
  * are all FC reagents full in the C6? If not, fill them and turn on the flow cytometry to ensure everything is in working order
  * prep probes of interest
      * for example: JC-10, a 10xdilution of the stock solution allows for ease of pipetting to acheive 5uM in our hemolymph samples (review the hyperlink to the protocol above!)
* Prep workspace (day of)
  * gather all materials needed to bleed (syringes, needles, ice, ice box, FC tubes)
  * prepare dark space (cooler, aluminum foil, box, blackout room, etc.)
  * add 100ul 22um ice cold FSW to each tube for adding Hemolymph
  * label tubes accordingly (scallop ID, treatment, FC probe, etc.)
