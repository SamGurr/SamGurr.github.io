# Initial diagnostics upon sequence upload to HPC
--------------------------------------------

# Assemble cumulative md5 reference

* Genewiz provides a one txt line .md5 file for each of the .gz sequence files

You can concatenate using 'cat *.md5 > new_file.md5'

	- example: cat *.md5 > ~/Airradians_lcWGS/F0_F2_April2023/output/md5checksum/April2023_reference.md5

* first objective to assemble a cumulative file with these text lines in one .txt

- view the multiqc.html report and note observations to guide trimming!

  - **Per Sequence GC Content**: double peak of ~0-10% GC and 30-40% GC

  - **Mean Quality Scores*&: >22-2; **To do:** *trim base calls < 30*

  - **Per Base Sequence Content**: 15-25% C and G, 25-28% T, 35-40+% A

  - **Adapter Content**: high adapters present, 1-6% of sequences; **To do:** *trim adapter sequence*


# Trimming and post-trim quality check of 'clean' reads
-------------------------------------------

### What this script will do...

- ``` --adapter_sequence ``` =
	- trim adapter sequence ```AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA```
	- common single-end adapter in Illumina. You can run a test on a fastq.gz to count
	
- ```multiqc ./``` = outputs mutliqc report of the 'clean' reads in the current directory

## HISAT2 alignment

**About:** HISAT2 is a sensitive alignment program for mapping sequencing reads.
In our case here, we will use HISAT2 to **(1)** index our reference genome **(2)** align our adapter-trimmed Bay scallop reads to the indexed reference genome.

More information on HISAT2 can be read [here](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/manual/)!

*Main arguments used below*:

**(1)** *Index the reference genome*

``` hisat2-build ``` =
builds a HISAT2 index from a set of DNA sequences. Outputs 6 files that together consitute the index.
ALL output files are needed to slign reads to the reference genome and the original sequence FASTA file(s)
are no longer used for th HISAT2 alignment

``` -f <reads.fasta> ``` =
the reads (i.e <m1>, <m2>, <m100>)
FASTA files usually have extension .fa, .fasta, .mfa, .fna or similar.
FASTA files do not have a way of specifying quality values, so when -f is set,
the result is as if --ignore-quals is also set

Note: other options for your reads are ```-q ``` for FASTQ files,

 ```--qseq ``` for QSEQ  files, etc. - check [here](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/manual/) for more file types

**(2)** *align reads to reference*

``` -x <hisat2-indx> ``` =
base name for the index reference genome, first looks in the current directory then in the directory specified in HISAT_INDEXES environment variable

``` --dta ``` =
 **important!** reports the alignments tailored for *StringTie* assembler.
 With this option, HISAT2 requires longer anchor lengths for de novo discovery of splice sites.
 This leads to fewer alignments with short-anchors, which helps transcript assemblers improve
 significantly in computation and memory usage.

 This is important relative to Cufflinks ```--dta-cufflinks```
 in which HISAT2 looks for novel splice sites with three signals (GT/AG, GC/AG, AT/AC)

``` -U <r> ``` =
Comma-separated list of files contained unparied reads to be aligned.
*In other words...*, our array of post-trimmed 'clean' TagSeq reads

``` -p NTHREADS``` =
Runs on separate processors, increasing -p increases HISAT2's memory footprint, increasing -p from 1 to 8
increased the footprint by a few hundred megabytes

Note: Erin Chile from Putnam Lab ran -p 8 for HISAT2 alignment of *Montipora* [here](https://github.com/echille/Montipora_OA_Development_Timeseries/blob/master/Amil/amil_RNAseq-analysis.sh)

``` -S <hit> ``` =
file to write SAM alignments to. By default, alignments are written to the “standard out” or “stdout” filehandle (i.e. the console).

**Note:** HISAT2 also has several criteria to trim such as the phred score and base count 5' (left) and 3' (right)
Since we already assessed quality and trimmed, we will not use these commands


## samtools

**About:** used to manipuate alignments to a binary BAM format - files contain the spliced reads alignemnts sorted by the reference position
with a tag to indicate the genomic strand that produced the RNA from which the read was sequenced.
samtools quickly extracts alignments overlapping particular genomic regions - outputs allow viewers to quickly display alignments in each genomic region
note: the SAM format output by HISAT2 must be sorted and converted to BAM format using the samtools program

``` sort ``` =
sorts the alignments by the leftmost coordinates

```-o <out.bam``` =
outputs as a specified .bam file

```-@ threads``` =
Set number of sorting and compression threads. By default, operation is single-threaded

more information on samtools commands [here](http://www.htslib.org/doc/1.1/samtools.html)

## HPC Job: HISAT2 Index Reference and Alignment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- create directory output\hisat2

- HISAT2 complete 


## Look at your percent alignment!


* - use `grep -hnr "overall"` as your diagnostic delimiter where % mapping is reported by the error file from the hisat2 job 
 
```
grep -hnr "overall" <**add your error report here**>  > percent_mapped.txt
```

* example of the 'percent_mapped.txt file below

```
cat percent_mapped.txt -5 | head -5
``` 

84:78.45% overall alignment rate
91:75.11% overall alignment rate
98:79.48% overall alignment rate
105:76.95% overall alignment rate
112:80.56% overall alignment rate

* we see that our alignment at least for the first few files was ~75-81%!

## ANGSD: Genotype Likelihood
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ANGSD wikipedia-like site for all call  definitions and tutorial items here: http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Main_Page

## About some core ANGSD calls...

```-GL``` =

	*	1: SAMtools model

	*	2: GATK model

* quality filtering

```-minQ``` = minimum phred quality score

```-minMapQ``` = minimum mapping quality score

* note: studies use a minQ of 30-32 depending on how consersative you want your base calls

```-minInd``` = the minimum representation of the variant in your data.

* note: contemporary studies use a threshold so >80% of individuals are represented

* thoughts... if you have 100 from population A and 100 from population B, should you:
	- (a) GLs as -minInd 160 for all 200 samples
	- (b) two GLs separately for each population with -minQ 80 for 100 samples

**pvalues**

```-snp_pval``` = SNP p value

* angsd tutorials set this quite low to 1X10-6 (0.000001), however studies do set this to simply 0.05 also

```-sb_pvalue``` = strand bias

```-hetbias_pval``` = hetbias p value, based on reads of genotypes that are called to be heterozygotes - requires the -doGeno option

```-anc``` = ancetral state, if you do not have this you can use the assembly that you have maped against but remember to add -fold 1 n readSFS and real SFS sf2theta step

```-doMaf``` =+9+

	*	1: Known major, and Known minor.
		   Here both the major and minor allele is assumed to be known (inferred or given by user).
		   The allele frequency is the obtained using based on the genotype likelihoods.
		   The allele frequency estimator from genotype likelihoods are from this publication but using the EM algorithm and is briefly described here.

	* 	2: Known major, Unknown minor.Here the major allele is assumed to be known (inferred or given by user) however the minor allele is not determined.
		   Instead we sum over the 3 possible minor alleles weighted by their probabilities.

	*	4: frequency based on genotype posterior probabilities.If genotype probabilities are used as input to ANGSD the allele frequency is estimated directly on these by summing over the probabitlies.

	*	8: frequency based on base counts.This method does not rely on genotype likelihood or probabilities but instead infers the allele frequency directly on the base counts.


* example: doMaf 1 outputs 'knownEM' as an allele frequency value based on geneotype liklihoods of the minor and manjor allele assumed as known

```-doMajorMinor``` =

	*	1: Infer major and minor from GL

	*	2: Infer major and minor from allele counts

	*	3: use major and minor from a file (requires -sites file.txt)

	*	4: Use reference allele as major (requires -ref)

	*	5: Use ancestral allele as major (requires -anc)


```-P``` =

	*	number of threads that you are running your GL

```-ref``` =

	*	if emplying -doMajorMinor 4, if forces the major allele according to the reference, you will need to define this by a fasta (___.fa) file


Before getting started..

we first need a file containg the root to all bam files from home dir - below as 'bam_filelist.txt'

```
ls Airradians_lcWGS/F1/output/alignment/hisat2/*gz.bam > Airradians_lcWGS/F1/output/alignment/hisat2/bam_filelist.txt
```

Now we can run a test script for the angsd call for bam file input

### How to read this output?

* we have 6 total columns as..

	*  'chromo' == the chromosome number # because of the scaffold stage of this genome reference (NCBI Airradians fasta), these are simply contigs and the position on contigs 

	* 'position' == bp number/position within each chromosome # as described above - not chromosome, contig for us! (wish it was chromosome!)

	* 'major' == major allele at the noted position

	* 'minor' == minor allele at the noted position

	* 'unknownEM' == the minor allele frequency

	* 'nInd' == the number of individuals for which there is coverage at each SNP

* thus, at Contig0 18 we have a high frequency of th eminor allale 'A' exhibited by 45 individuals, but wait.... how is this possible if we only have 25 ini

* ...and why do later contigs show more relevant sample numbers?


* **NOTE:** are the regions with SNP positions of high or poor mapping quality?
are the regions with SNP position of excessive coverage?
You may need to supplement a csv(s) with categorical justification of regions with varied quality or putatively high-repeated regions (excessive coverage),
filtering these cumulative SNP hits downstream in R


# Appears we need to merge our paired-end reads!!

*Should we merge BEFORE or AFTER mapping?*

	* (1) merging after mapped

	* (2) merge before mapped

## Merge bams after mapping (hisat2 outputs)

### <span style="color:red">IMPORTANT:<span> merge lanes here (.bam stage)


* nav to target dir

```
<navigate the the hisat2 directory with you paired-end .bam outputs>
```

* example file 'adapter_trim.352_R2_001.fastq.gz.bam'

* mkdir for merged bam files

```
mkdir merged_bam_files

cd merged_bam_files
```

* enter interactive mode

```
interactive
```

* load samtools

```
module load bio/samtools/1.15.1
```

*  ID file lists the sample ID characters (i.e. adapter_trim.101) - sample .bam file adapter_trim.101_R1_001.fastq.gz.bam

```
ls *R1_001*.bam | awk -F '[_]' '{print $1"_"$2}' | sort | uniq > ID
```

* output looks like this:

```
../adapter_trim.101
../adapter_trim.103
../adapter_trim.104
../adapter_trim.153

../adapter_trim.353dup
../adapter_trim.4
../adapter_trim.5
../adapter_trim.53
../adapter_trim.54

```

- for loop using ```samtools``` to merge bam files together by sample ID ('ID' created above)
- example of files to merge: adapter_trim.101_R1_001.fastq.gz.bam and adapter_trim.101_R2_001.fastq.gz.bam - where 'R1' and 'R2' are paired-end reads
and the ID called adapter_trim.101 as $i below... (note: all .gz file names end with '001.fastq.gz.bam' no matter the lane)

```
for i in `cat ./ID`;
	do samtools merge $i\.bam $i\_R1_001.fastq.gz.bam $i\_R2_001.fastq.gz.bam;
	done
```

- when run in ```interactive``` mode, this loop takes up to ~1-2 hours

## Call root directory of the merged bam files

* when running **angsd**, we will need to call these merged bam files as a txt list file

* below is an example calling bam file lists for the Low pCO2 and moderately elevated pCO2 F1 cohort - an example with the first 25 samples form October 2022

	- Moderately-elevated pCO2 cohort, 12 animals with the IDs in the 300s and 200s

ls -d "$PWD"/*.35*.bam "$PWD"/*30*.bam "$PWD"/*.2*.bam > Mod_pCO2_bamlist.txt

	- Low pCO2 cohort, 12 animals with the IDs 3,4,5 and in the 100s

ls -d "$PWD"/*.3.bam "$PWD"/*.4.bam "$PWD"/*.5*.bam "$PWD"/*.1*.bam > Low_pCO2_bamlist.txt


## Lets run ANGSD!

* **Objective**: obtain SNP calls. chromosome/contig positions to infer genotype liklihoods and putativelly adaptive molecular candidates (we also have differential expression work!)

Terms to know regarding assemblies:

**contigs** - genome assemblies are hierarchical - contigs are the shortest assembly component of a
genome in which a contiguous length of genomic sequence is known on a high confidence level

**scaffolds** - comprised of contigs, a longer component on this assembly hierachy,
created from chaining contigs together using additional information on the orientation of the contigs and their relative position.
Contigs in scallods can be separated by gaps represented as 'N'

**chromosomes** - assembled seqeunces from compoentns (scallods and thus originally contigs) the largest
genome assembly cmoponent comprised of assembled scaffolds, requires sufficient mapping information to build from the scaffold level
