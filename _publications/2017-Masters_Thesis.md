excerpt: 'Coastal dynamic stressors demand a high-resolution proxy for performance. Here my thesis summarizes research from 2015-2017 on the cardiac activity and growth of adult Bay scallops under in-situ hypoxia and laboratory challenges (accompanied with metabolic rates and condition indices). I propose a model for the aerobic and anaerobic implications of cardiac response under diel-cycling hypoxia.'
