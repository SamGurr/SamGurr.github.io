excerpt: 'Experiments in summer 2018 required a continuous and accuracte diet for rearing juvenile geoduck. This app not was written for the Nexcelom Cellometer, an instrument that used bright-field images to count cells - I used the Cellometer to count large algae batch cultures daily for a continous mixed-algae diet. TO the best of my knowledge, this was the first time the Cellometer was used in a sustainable hatchery setting.'
