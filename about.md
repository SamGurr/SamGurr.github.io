### Hi, welcome to my lab notebook page!

**Here you will find a hodgepodge of ideas, analysis, detours/roadblocks, and few successes along the way..**

I strive to maintain data transparency and reproducibility in my scientific endeavors - this notebook is platformed in GitHub, providing a more detailed view in real-time documents complimentary to linked data and analytical repositories on my GithHub: {% include icon-github.html username="samgurr" %}
Listed below are few expected materials on my page

- **Thoughts and graphics/figures**
	* "*~~a picture says 1..~~*" "*a well-designed figure provides 1000 takeaways messages*". Taking care to build eye-catching graphics for ideas, data, and results often catalyzes my motivation to write. I enjoy summarizing the complexities of my research down to an aesthetically pleasing and informative visual - happy to brainstorm data visualization!

- **Benchwork and experiment SOPs**
	* extractions / library prep / diagnostics
  * tissue homogenate / hemolymph assessments (i.e. spec and flow cy)
  * suite of physiological metrics - respirometry, biodeposition, clearance rate, etc.

- **Computational work**
  * *..a work in progress*, bioinformatics takes a large chunk of my time and the many rabbit holes and roadblocks are not well documented here.. yet!

**Theme credit**: This notebook is built with Jekyll & forked from Michael Rose https://github.com/mmistakes and improved with edited material from a variety of online lab notebook layouts. Thanks to all.
