## Welcome to my page!

---

Here you will find a hodgepodge of ideas, analysis, detours/roadblocks, and few successes along the way..

I strive to maintain data transparency and reproducibility in my scientific endeavors - this page is platformed in GitHub, providing a more detailed view in real-time documents complimentary to linked data and analytical repositories on my GithHub: {% include icon-github.html username="samgurr" %}

Listed below are few expected materials in my notebook

- **Thoughts and graphics/figures**
	* "*~~a picture says 1..~~*" "*a well-designed figure provides 1000 takeaways messages*". Taking care to build eye-catching graphics for ideas, data, and results often catalyzes my motivation to write. I enjoy summarizing the complexities of my research down to an aesthetically pleasing and informative visual - happy to brainstorm data visualization!

- **Benchwork and experimental SOPs**
	* extractions / library prep / diagnostics
  * tissue homogenate / hemolymph assessments (i.e. spec and flow cy)
  * suite of physiological metrics - respirometry, biodeposition, clearance rate, etc.

- **Computational work**
	* Full HPC  pipelines for transcriptomics and genomics projects:
    * General bash carpentry: grep, sed, etc.
		* QC processing: fastp, fastQC, multiQC
		* Mapping tools: Bowtie2, Stringtie, HISAT
		* SNP calling: ANGSD
		* and more.. (i.e. primer design, python, augustus, etc.)
	* R tips, tricks, and RShiny
  * *..a work in progress*, bioinformatics takes a large chunk of my time and the many rabbit holes and roadblocks are not well documented here.. yet!

**Theme credit**: This notebook is built with Jekyll & forked from Michael Rose https://github.com/mmistakes and improved with edited material from a variety of online lab notebook layouts. Thanks to all.
